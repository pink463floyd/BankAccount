# BankAccount

This is a simple object which I use when demonstrating how TDD works to folks that are new to TDD. 

This example is written in Java, but the concepts here can be used for any Object Oriented language.

Most developers could code a bank account object with their eyes closed, so its usefull for introducing TDD. 

Best to introduce new concepts one at a time.
